## Huge thanks to Sean Morley [(@seanmorley15)](https://github.com/seanmorley15) for creating such a well-made project üç∫

This is a fork of [Sean Morley's](https://seanmorley.com/) [AdventureLog](https://github.com/seanmorley15/AdventureLog/) that is dedicated to tracking visits to breweries. And, yes, I already know about Untappd and agree it's already perfectly suited for this task :smile: -- I just wanted to tinker üçª

# How to set this up
- Clone the repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BreweryLog.git
  ```
- Change to the BreweryLog directory:
  ```
  cd BreweryLog
  ```
- Edit `docker-compose.yml` to configure your installation. See the original [AdventureLog documentation](https://adventurelog.app/docs/install/docker.html) regarding configuration parameters.
- Then build everything:
  ```
  docker compose build -d && docker logs -f brewerylog-backend
  ```
